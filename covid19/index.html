Mathematical models can help decision makers implement effective strategies to mitigate the spread of such diseases. It is important to note that these models are based on specific assumptions and therefore do not convey any clinical advice but instead provide invaluable information to administrators. This information is especially important in times like these when the dynamics of diseases such as COVID-19 are somewhat unknown. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Model Architecture:</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c8 c18"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">In a simple SIR model, the total population can be divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered [1]. Differential equations can effectively explain the relationships between these compartments and provide us ways to model a dynamic system. &nbsp;In this article, we’ve extended the SIR model to create a SEIRDL model, in which population is divided into the following 6 compartments:</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image1.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Total susceptible population at time t</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image2.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Total population exposed to the infectant</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image3.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Total infected population at time t</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image4.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Total recovered population at time t</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Total deaths due to the disease at time t</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image6.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Total population under lockdown at time t</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">The relationship between these compartments is depicted in the model displayed in Figure 1. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 183.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image76.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 183.07px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Figure 1.

Total expected births in the total population is controlled by the overall birth rate for the given population. In our model, newborns are not treated differently from adults in terms of their susceptibility to the disease and therefore total newborns per day are added to the susceptible compartment. The exact nature of many infectious diseases is also not completely known. For example, it is currently not known if a single exposure to COVID-19 procures enough immunity for a recovered individual to stay healthy and not get a second infection. This is why some individuals losing their immunity from the recovered compartment are added to the susceptible compartment. The enforcement of a lockdown causes a sudden decrease in the susceptible population as most of the population is now in the lockdown compartment. While the lockdown is ongoing, the lockdown population is still being removed by natural deaths. The termination of the lockdown brings back the entire lockdown population back into the susceptible compartment. Within the susceptible population, people are removed as they die of natural causes. Upon initiation of a vaccination, the susceptible population can be thought of as being recovered and therefore directly moving from the susceptible compartment to the recovered compartment. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">The force of infection defines the rate at which the susceptible population is getting exposed to a virus. Exposure to the virus moves individuals from the susceptible compartment to the exposed compartment. The virally exposed population is also being removed by natural deaths occurring within this compartment. Upon the expiration of the incubation period, the exposed individuals become infected and therefore are moved from the exposed compartment to the infected compartment. The infected population is being removed by natural deaths occurring within this compartment. In addition, infected individuals dying specifically from the infectious disease are moved to the dead compartment. Those surviving are moved to the recovered compartment. The flow of this is controlled by the rate of recovery. Within the recovered population, people dying of natural causes are removed along with people losing their immunity and becoming susceptible again. The total susceptible population receiving vaccines is moved to the recovered compartment and the flow is controlled by the rate of vaccination. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Model Parameters:</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image7.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Birth rate (# born / day)</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image8.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Natural death rate</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image9.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;= Infection rate = the rate of transmission of the disease = </span><img src="images/image10.png"></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;= Rate at which exposed individuals become infected = (incubation period)</span><span class="c4 c22">-1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image12.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Rate of recovery</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image13.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Rate of death due to the disease</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image14.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;= Rate at which people die = (No. of days it takes from exposure to death)</span><span class="c4 c22">-1</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image15.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity and become susceptible again</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image16.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Lockdown (start) rate = Percent of population getting under lockdown each day</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image17.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Lockdown (end) rate = Percent of population under lockdown becoming susceptible each day</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image18.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Rate of vaccination </span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image19.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp; = Infectious period = </span><img src="images/image20.png"></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image21.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp; = Force of infection = </span><img src="images/image22.png"><span class="c0">, where I/N is relative proportion of the infected individuals, namely, frequency or prevalence of infection</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image23.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;= Basic reproduction number = average secondary infections produced by an infected individual = constant for a disease</span></p><p class="c3"><img src="images/image24.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp; = Effective reproduction number at time t</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Based on the model depicted in Figure 1 and the set of variables controlling the relationships between various compartments, a first-order linear equation can be written for each of the compartments. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Model Equations</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.2abc8120ce67d440c17f45203213116b3b57f6b5"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c16"><tbody><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><img src="images/image25.png"></p></td><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="7"><p class="c13"><span class="c9">(1)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><img src="images/image26.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><img src="images/image27.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><img src="images/image28.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><img src="images/image29.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><img src="images/image30.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><img src="images/image31.png"><span class="c4">, </span><img src="images/image32.png"><span class="c4">, </span><img src="images/image33.png"><span class="c4">, </span><img src="images/image34.png"><span class="c4">, </span><img src="images/image35.png"><span class="c4">, </span><img src="images/image36.png"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Model Assumptions</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Infectious diseases are assumed to be transferred between individuals via contact and are assumed to be contagious. While individuals of different age and different health histories might be more susceptible to catch the disease or survive the disease, in this model, we assume that everyone has an equal chance of acquiring the infection. The percent of recovered individuals in the population that lose immunity to the virus and become susceptible again are not known. If the disease is prone to only confer short-term immunity in most individuals, the model might not accurately predict the course of infection. Asymptotic individuals are assumed to carry the infection and are placed in the Exposed compartment until the incubation period expires. Finally, the disease is thought to be an acute illness with a relatively short recovery period (the infection won’t last for months).</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">Reproduction Numbers (</span><img src="images/image23.png"><span class="c8 c20">&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image37.png"><span class="c8 c20">):</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">Reproduction number is an important quantity in epidemiological models. The reproduction number gives us an outlook of the average number of secondary infections that are produced among susceptible populations by one infected individual. While the basic reproduction number, </span><img src="images/image23.png"><span class="c4">, remains constant for a disease, the effective reproduction number can vary over the course of the pandemic. The time-dependent value of </span><img src="images/image37.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;can be determined using the following equation which is heavily used in literature [2]:</span></p><a id="t.892c2015b7a18a4021b64b74e11b30b6ad283248"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c17"><tbody><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><img src="images/image38.png"><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span></p></td><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c9">(2)</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">For infectious diseases such as the coronavirus to persist in a population, the reproduction number must exceed 1, suggesting that the infected individual, on average, produces more than one secondary infection. On the contrary, for an infectious disease to slowly die out over time, the value of the reproduction number must stay below 1. With this in mind, it’s very easy to see in Equation 2 that the most effective way to reduce the effective reproduction number is to reduce the total susceptible population at time t. This can be achieved by implementing strict lockdowns or stay-at-home orders. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Modeling COVID-19</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now that we have the basics epidemiological models understood, let’s plugin sample data into our model and gather some insights. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">In the United States, there are ~11.8 births per 1,000 population in a year. This means that the daily birth rate, </span><img src="images/image7.png"><span class="c4">, is taken to be 11.8/365,000 [3]. There are also 863.8 natural deaths occurring in the United States each year per 100,000 population resulting in a daily natural death rate, </span><img src="images/image8.png"><span class="c0">, of 863.8/36,500,000 [4]. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">For this sample data, let’s assume that the infectious period is </span><img src="images/image39.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;days and the incubation period of the virus is </span><img src="images/image40.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;days. The basic reproduction number is still not determined for COVID-19, however, in this model, we have used </span><img src="images/image41.png"><span class="c4">. Based on the data from JHU’s COVID-19 data, the mortality rate due to COVID-19 in the United States is </span><img src="images/image42.png"><span class="c4">, however, this value might vary in different places [5]. Among the deaths occurring due to COVID-19, the number of days to death from infection is taken to be </span><img src="images/image43.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;days. Let’s also assume that about </span><img src="images/image44.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the recovered individuals are losing immunity and again becoming susceptible to the virus. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">1. Worst-case Scenario.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">In the worst-case scenario, it is assumed that no preventive measures such as lockdowns, social distancing or vaccinations are implemented at all. In this case, let us use the same parameters described above and keep the lockdown implementation rate, lockdown termination rate, and vaccination rate to be zero. With these parameters, we will model the outbreak for a population of 170,000 without any large-scale lockdowns or vaccinations.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 496.08px; height: 446.74px;"><img alt="" src="images/image78.png" style="width: 496.08px; height: 446.74px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Figure 2. Worst-case scenario for a COVID-19 like disease for a population of 170,000 with the following parameters: UInput(170_000, 3.0, 4, 8,0.055, 9, 0.02, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The worst-case scenario modeled by inputting the sample data results in Figure 2, with more than 10,000 individuals having the infection on a single peak day. Again, note that this is a worst-case scenario and very unlikely to happen in the real-world. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">2. Waves of Infections with a need for Multiple Spaced Out Lockdowns.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Waves of infectious diseases are common and are seen in the regular flu cycle. The waves persist in the population for at least until an effective vaccine for a given strain of the virus is implemented at a large-scale within the population [6]. However, without a successful implementation of the vaccine, waves of infection are a real possibility. As seen in the 1918 pandemic, the pandemic not only had repeated waves but the second wave was actually way worse than the first one. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">By the end of April, the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 for many states in America started to fall below one. This allowed many decision makers to reopen their communities. However, as clearly seen in our model, the second wave of the COVID-19 is very much possible. With excessive interactions in this latent period of relaxed restrictions along with the start of the regular flu season in the Fall, it is very important to prepare for the second wave of COVID-19. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now let’s assume that the lockdown for a population of 170,000 starts on day 50 and lasts for 100 days. The first lockdown effectively flattens the first peak, however, as seen in Figure 3, the second peak is almost inevitable. Without any type of secondary lockdown, vaccination or any other preventive measures, the second peak is expected to be much bigger with a much higher peak of infected individuals than the original peak. This is a direct result of not implementing any lockdowns during the second wave. If no preventive measures are taken during the second wave, our model predicts that the second wave will be more destructive than the initial wave. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 530.67px; height: 491.66px;"><img alt="" src="images/image77.png" style="width: 530.67px; height: 491.66px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Figure 3. The first peak of the outbreak is effectively flattened by lockdown implementation on Day 50, which lasts for 100 days. No further preventive measures are taken following a single lockdown. UInput(170_000, 3.0, 4, 8, 0.055, 9, 0.02, 50, 150, 0.5, 0.9, 0, 0)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We can also model implementation of preventive measures during the second wave by simply assuming that vaccination will start in the middle of the second-wave. To keep the model simple, no secondary lockdown compartment is included but the implementation of vaccine (discussed in a later section) should produce very similar results. We will simply assume that the vaccination started on day 260 at 70% rate. This will flatten out the second peak allowing us to easily compare the two peaks in the Figure 4. Overall, preventive measures are needed to significantly flatten the second peak in comparison to the second peak in Figure 3.</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 538.46px; height: 489.85px;"><img alt="" src="images/image80.png" style="width: 538.46px; height: 489.85px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c6">Figure 4. First peak of the outbreak is flattened by implementing the lockdown on Day 50, which lasts for 100 days. To easily visualize both peaks in one diagram, 70% vaccination implementation on Day 260 is included, which has an overall effect of flattening the second peak. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c6">UInput(170_000, 3.0, 4, 8, 0.055, 9, 0.02, 50, 150, 0.5, 0.9, 260, 0.7)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">From this analysis, it is clear that a second wave of infection for COVID-19 is likely to occur. When the cases of infection start to increase again after the extended period of relaxation, it is recommended to reinstate preventive measures as early as possible. In summary, our model suggests that implementation of multiple spaced out lockdowns will be necessary to take into account for the repeated waves of infection until an effective vaccine is given to the susceptible population at a large-scale. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">3. Importance of an Early Lockdown</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">As the coronavirus spread across many countries, we saw some places such as Wuhan, China, implement some of the earliest lockdowns.

Vaccination Implementation Modeling:</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Starting in early March, we have been hearing a lot about the necessity of effective vaccines to fight COVID-19. However, as experts suggest, it is very important for each developed vaccine prototype to undergo randomized controlled trials to determine its validity and reliability. While the researchers are trying to safely accelerate the timeline, the actual large-scale vaccination is still believed to initiate in January at best [9]. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">Again, in Equation 1, variable </span><img src="images/image70.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;is listed as a constant for simplicity, however, we can model the impact of the vaccination by first defining </span><img src="images/image70.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;as time-dependent as shown below:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><a id="t.ce75cf13af64df8b0cf94247c11a87d3362690c7"></a><a id="t.3"></a><table class="c17"><tbody><tr class="c5"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><img src="images/image71.png"></p></td><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c9">(4)</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c24">Where </span><img src="images/image72.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the first day the vaccination begins and </span><img src="images/image73.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the percent of the population that begins receiving the vaccine starting on day </span><img src="images/image72.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;and onwards. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">As seen in Equation 4, the impact of </span><img src="images/image73.png"><span class="c4">&nbsp;is null before the given start day of vaccination (</span><img src="images/image72.png"><span class="c4">), however, after day </span><img src="images/image72.png"><span class="c0">, a part of the individuals in the susceptible population are moved to the recovered compartment each day. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">In Figure 4, we saw the impact of a 70% vaccination starting on day </span><img src="images/image74.png"><span class="c4">.

The main purpose of scientific models, such as the one presented here, is not to exactly predict the epidemic but to provide one scientific perspective to help decision makers as well as those of us stuck in the quarantine to make sound decisions on what to do next. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">By changing the model parameters, it is easy for us to see how the predictions of the model change. This also shows us the value of the accurate input data, which is what all scientific models are dependent on to produce valid results. In the real-world, thousands of different variables may contribute to the exact dynamics of COVID-19, but here we only analyze a few of those variables. While the exactness of these models can be argued, the insights gathered from them are pretty robust in these times of uncertainty. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">First and foremost, early and strict lockdowns have the biggest impact in lowering the effective reproduction number and therefore, reducing the total population from getting infected. Second, it is important to not ignore second waves of the infection as they may cause more damage if preventive measures are not placed early in the second wave. And at last, an early and safe implementation of vaccines is considered to play the biggest role in both flattening the infection curve and preventing future waves of infection. </span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">References:</span></p><p class="c3 c7"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c14">Edelstein-Keshet, Leah. </span><span class="c4 c19">Mathematical models in biology</span><span class="c0">.
